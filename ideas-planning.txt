--------------------------------------------------------
v1.2 Concept ideas:
Prestige layer that resets everything
"Times prestiged" Milestone system for boosts/qol (Starts with x2 to XP, XPBoost, loot, stats and dimensions)
Some sort of upgrade tiers like "Starts with pet (x) on reset" "Starts with upgrades (x-y) bought"
Early progression will be based on speeding up everything as much as possible
Enters a "corruption" realm with nerfs after getting most qol stuff
Corrupted runs lets the player obtain "research points", needed to achieve powerful upgrades
Those upgrades can only be used through corrupted runs
---------------------------------------------------------
To be added ideas:
-Push notifications when a button is ready [should take a look into it + settings]
---------------------------------------------------------
Future reference for future features:

for (let i=0;i<game.pets.length;i++) {if (game.pets[i] is in some form) game.pets[i] = 0}
---------------------------------------------------------
Will note down things here that I experiment when playing in the new save
-Move the level 50k stat button to level 5k
-Shop costs changes
  -Upgrade 4 5 cats/shiny rats --> 1
  -These pets have been added to other crates, so their drop rates are way higher. Their amounts should be buffed: Red butterfly/Lilypad/Spirit/Fire spectral/Holy pig/Fire lord
---------------------------------------------------------
