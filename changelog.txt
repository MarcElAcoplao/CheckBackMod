v0.9.1
-Did some changes in the xp to next level bar
  -Once you reach level 1500 [the shop], the bar changes to "XP to next unlock", showing all the jump there is in terms of xp
   -Therefore, when you reach the highest possible xp unlock [level 100k], the bar simply changes to "Total XP"
-Some slight changes in 0.9.0.1 and 0.9.0.2 [Just realises I never pushed v0.9.0.2]

v0.9.0.2
-Added actual rarities to the enemies in the 3rd zone [they were all 20% each]

v0.9.0.1
-Fixed an issue with new saves

v0.9 Update - A little bit of everything!
-New crate!
  -Unlocks at level 20k
  -Costs 250 coins to open one [And has a base cooldown of 12h]
  -Has some of the rarest pets and also the most busted ones. Good luck for anyone trying to get all of them.
-New upgrades!
  -You need level 20k to see these upgrades and to buy them
  -These are quite expensive and require some of the new pets
-New area!
  -Unlocked at level 100k
  -Has 5 new powerful enemies [loot focused on xp gains]
-New stat button!
  -Unlocked at level 50k
  -Gives x4 the previous stats at just x6 the cooldown (20hp 2dmg 0.2 def / 6h)
-Fixed some bugs related to cost upgrades
-Better compatibility with older saves [mainly people importing from Demonin's original version]
-Some themes have been tweaked slightly to look better. [Neon still on top]

v0.8.0.1
-Fixed a bug where the 4th upgrade would take something else instead of the actual pet

v0.8 The Item Shop!
-New feature unlocked at level 1500! The shop!
  -Items in the shop have a cost, which is usually coins and some pets. They give an effect.
  -Some of the effects are increased XP gain and increased XPBoost gain.
  -Some of these items are more important, as they give QoL or new unlocks. They are more expensive though
-New area
  -6 strong enemies are waiting for you. They do give a bunch of coins
-Many changes and improvements.
  -Help button! Provides a quick guide on what to do.
  -Stuff like the xpboost info is now being refreshed constantly rather than just when it updates [through in-game features and not console].
  -Hidden stats, lost xp and highest level. No way to check them ingame but they do exist [it's gonna be on the save string and on console, possibly gonna be added in some other update].
  -The "all unlocks" message now tells you what's considered endgame [and makes you expect a new update]
   -Once you get to the shop, the game will tell you there's level unlocks at () or through other means [like an upgrade]
   -Or that if you don't have all possible unlocks, but the remaining unlocks are non xp related, it hints that you should try look somewhere else
-And more stuff and improvements, tell me if there's any issue with the game.
  

v0.7.0.5
-Fighting tab button now has a visual indicator on when there's a fight ready [similar to daily reward]

v0.7.0.4
-Advanced pet crate [2nd one] had their rarities bugged, now fixed them [blue dragons were x11 as common]

v0.7.0.3
-Added the rounding display to XPBoost
-Fixed an issue with levels if you would get to I believe past level 1m
-Remade the rounding system slightly so it's easier to work with [has an exponent function]
 -Has another tier of rounding for billions, then it would jump into scientific at trillions [or 1e12]

v0.7.0.2
-The enemy selected is set to 1 when you get to level 500 [also by default when you refresh], should fix a small issue with sometimes the button not working
-Added the rounding to the daily rewards

v0.7 Fighting update (And happy new year update)
- Fixed a bug with prestige crates when you can't open them. Now it prevents you from dropping XPBoost below 1 [imagine opening one that costs 1.3 and getting a negative boost :skull:]
- Added rounding to buttons. Now they will display "3542" as "3.5k" XP. Also added it to the pets tab [xp and xpboost boosts] and the new feature.
- Added a softcap to XPBoost effect. After you reach 10, it will start increasing at square root rate [possible that in future updates it will get softer]
- New feature unlocked at level 500: FIGHTING!
  - Increase your stats (HP, DMG and DEF) through a new button with 1h cooldown
  - Fighting tab
   - Displays your current stats
   - Allows you to start a combat in one area
     - Combat system: 
     1- You and the enemy deal damage based on their own damage and the receiver's defense
     2- If the player deals no damage, the battle ends
     3- If the enemy hp is below 0, the battle ends and it rolls rewards [they are based on a set tier and some of the enemy stats]
     4- If the player hp is below 0, the battle ends
     5- If the battle hasn't ended in any way, it goes back to step 1
    - Has buttons to pick whatever area you wanna fight [Each area has some set of enemies with their rarities, hover over the button to display the rarities]
    - 1st area is unlocked at level 500, enemies drop XP, coins [a new resource, no display and no use as of now] and XPBoost [only the boss]
  - Enemies tab
   - Displays all the enemies and the amount you've killed of each
    - If you killed that enemy, you can hover over it to see their stats
If there's any issues or you feel something's weird with balancing, let me know. This update took a while to make [more effective hours than 0.4] and I want you all to enjoy it

v0.6.5 Improvement update
-Visuals like the xp bar and selected pets are now fixed on the screen. Scrolling will only affect buttons
-Pet XP Boosts were made simpler [compressed all xp-related things to only 1 stat]
  -Some stats have been rebalanced slightly
-Prestige button 3 buffed [2.5 --> 4 XPBoost]
-Added Dancing Skeleton as filler pet for pet ID reasons [same odds as skeletal dragon/slightly weaker stats]
-Special pets have been "removed" and now they are displayed after crate 6 as normal pets. To do the conversion, refresh 1-2 more times and click the "SpecialPet conversion" button.
  -Code was made simpler
Specifically in this update, let me know if there's any issues before I start working with the new feature

v0.6 - Endgame Resurrection Festival Party Fiesta
-2 New XP Buttons. Similar to the previous button, the cooldowns for these and the gains drop, but they are better than the normal ones.
  - 33 xp // 6h
  - 15 xp // 1h
-1 New prestige crate. New pets that have transcended and gained the ability to boost your XPBoost gain. Along being more expensive.
  - 2.5 XPBoost // ~268k xp
-1 New XPBoost button. Go wild with farming this one
-Call them "tier 2" buttons, and they have all been sorted. XPBoost are all together, xp 8-10 together and the 2 prestige crates also together.
-Changed the XPBoost display [it no longer shows as %]
-This was v0.5.0.1 but the 2 new buttons from v0.5 had been nerfed to be unlocked at levels 150 and 200, plus the prestige crate unlocking at 125.
-Added new XP ranks... reaching level 50k with almost 2b xp to grind. Good luck
-Note: Possibly adding a display of whenever the alerts show on a text, instead of using the alert function


v0.5 - Numbers Go Up version
-Added compatibility with older saves [updating a button cooldown that isn't defined will make it defined "I can do it for 25, and it creates slots from 0 to 25"]
-Balancing!
  -Buttons 2-6 are faster and button 7 gives more xp
  -Any prestige for XPBoost has now a set cooldown of 1h... if you are good, enjoy speedrunning these
  -Prestige crate 1 now unlocks at level 125
  -Prestige crate 1 has an 1h cooldown. Have fun buying it
-2 New buttons
  -Level 200, gives 100xp every day
  -Level 250, allows you to prestige for 1 XPBoost, also with 1h cooldown
-Possibly some bugs are fixed

-Changed the pet color border for prestige crate.

v0.4.1 - Polishing
-Added names and icons to the prestige crate pets
-Added an XPBoost display [will show in %, as 230% means x2.3]

v0.4 - The comeback
After a long time, I finally managed to fix the bug that was on my spine, thanks to boredom.
-New crate with op pets. BUT! They cost some of your XPBoost. So I hope you've been able to grind these
-Remade the special pets code slightly, they are now ID's 1 and 2, so anything bigger than 3 will be the normal pets [why you had to do this system demonin...]
-New crate icon for upcoming similar pets

    -Small note about this: You are only able to reset once a day, and when you reach level 100
    -Can be used as currency [v0.4.0]
-Balancing to make the game faster (Also because you need a lot of XP to progress)
