v1.1 Concept ideas:
A frozen themed crate unlocked at level 500m
It will reset all dimensions [like a dimension reset] but the amount of crates opened increases with tiers
1d cooldown, very big stat scaling, all dimensions multiplier stat coming from pets
Very rare pets [into the thousands] but considering that you open many crates at once [+100]
Big amounts of pets required
Also some sort of rebuyable upgrades

v1.2 Concept ideas:
Prestige layer that resets everything
"Times prestiged" Milestone system for boosts/qol (Starts with x2 to XP, XPBoost, loot, stats and dimensions)
Some sort of upgrade tiers like "Starts with pet (x) on reset" "Starts with upgrades (x-y) bought"
Early progression will be based on speeding up everything as much as possible
Also increases the amounts of crates opened


To be added ideas:
-Push notifications when a button is ready [should take a look into it + settings]

Future reference for future features:

for (let i=0;i<game.pets.length;i++) {if (game.pets[i] is in some form) game.pets[i] = 0}
